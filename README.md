A gear set builder for Monster Hunter World: Iceborne. Save a set of selected gear into a set for later viewing. Future plans involve adding the entire gear list, adding stat values to gear pieces, the built gearset displaying total stats of chosen gear, and a function to choose best in slot gear for stats/elemental resistances.
